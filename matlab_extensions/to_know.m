% With regards to the labeling of objects in Image Processing
% The functions bwlabel, BWLABELN, and BWCONNCOMP all compute connected
%     components for binary images.  BWCONNCOMP is the most recent addition
%     to the Image Processing Toolbox and is intended to replace the use
%     of bwlabel and BWLABELN.  It uses significantly less memory and is
%     sometimes faster than the older functions.
